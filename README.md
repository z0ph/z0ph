### Hi folks ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub, where I share my side projects and code experiences as an Independent AWS cloud architect.

My name is Victor Grenu, but you can also find me on Twitter as @zoph.

With a focus on Amazon Web Services (AWS), I specialize in designing secure, scalable, reliable, and cost-effective architectures for large-scale and mission-critical distributed systems, including microservices and serverless.

I also bring a wealth of experience in cloud security, DevSecOps, cost-saving strategies, operations management, modern application design, and cloud governance.

Through this GH, I hope to share my knowledge and insights with the community, and continue to learn and grow alongside others in the field. Thanks for visiting!
