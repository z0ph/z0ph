### Hi folks ðŸ‘‹

My name is Victor GRENU, aka ([@zoph](https://twitter.com/zoph)). Iâ€™m a kind of Problem Solver, Cloud Security Aficionados. I am living in Paris, France.

Iâ€™m an Independent Cloud Architect on Amazon Web Services (AWS), designing: secure, scalable, reliable, and cost-effective architectures and dealing with large-scale and mission-critical distributed systems. (microservices, serverless)

I also have good experience in Cloud Security, DevSecOps, Cost Saving (FinOps), Operations Management, Modern Applications Design, and Go to Cloud Strategy & Governance.

### Back in time

I started my career in Information Technology in 2005 in a glass factory at Saint-Gobain as a System Administrator in the little town of Mers-les-Bains, France.

Then, I became Technical Account Manager (TAM) at Microsoft, AWS Cloud Architect for Mediametrie, and Ops Manager for SNCF Logistics. And more recently, Senior Cloud Architect for ENGIE.
